List of changes

1.2.6	link with libiconv on AIX (thanks to Peter Duempert)
	changed handling of ALL: in SysIni -- it should now conform
	 to the documentation and Object Rexx (reported by Heiko Scheidt)
	place the cursor at the top of the screen in the win32 version of
	 SysCls
	fixed bug with end-of-line matches in RegStemSearch
	added some support for the static linking features of Regina
1.2.5	fixed crash retrieving unset values in SysIni on Unix

	 SysGetKey() under NT
	use realpath() to normalise the path, rather than doing it myself
	cosmetic changes to manual
	changes in the way variables are set and in the way numeric stems
	 are handled
1.2.2	fixed regression in SysFileTree (introduced in 1.2.0) -- subdirectory
	 searching failed on Unix if the directory fails the selection
	 criterion
	changed code with HAS_WCHAR option to make it correct -- compile
	 with this option on FreeBSD and Linux by default
1.2.1	fixed compile flags for NT (resulted in problems with SysGetKey and

	handle systems which don't define TIOCGWINSZ where I'm expecting it
	 (reported by Stian Askmann)
1.2.0	added SysToUnicode, SysFromUnicode, SysGetErrortext, and stubs for
	SysWinDecryptFile and SysWinEncryptFile
	fixed problem in SysFileTree -- it failed to return names for
	 files in leaf directories on most Unix systems when using the FO
	 flags
	never return . or .. from SysFileTree

	adjusted some of the make files
	worked around Linux compile problems in regscreenux.c
	removed a number of compile-time warnings
1.1.13	renamed addstr and adddummy to cha_addstr and cha_adddummy, removing
	a conflict with curses. The user-visible problem was failure of
	SysFileTree when called from THE (reported by M Hessling)
1.1.12	added sysini for Unix
	fixed bugs retrieving key and value names in sysini for NT
	normalised returned paths for SysFileTree under Unix (reported by M
	Hessling and Arne Hanssen)
1.1.11	fixed bug loading files with multiples of 1000 lines in regstemread
	fixed build problems on AIX
1.1.10	fixed size of stem created by regstemread (reported by Peter
	Duempert and Mark Hessling, with fix from Mark)
	fixed error reading files using regstemread when the file starts
	with a new-line (reported by Don E Groves, who also contributed
	a substantial number of changes which I have not got around to
	considering)
	fixed potential continuous loop in SysTempFileName (reported by
	Don E Groves, although I didn't adopt his fix)
1.1.9	added rxmessagebox and rxwinexec for NT
	added regstemsearch
	fixed problems adding and deleting at the end of a stem
	fixed some general problems with null termination in rxsupport 
	reduced memory usage of regstemread
	added Unix attribute support for SysFileTree
	changed licencing terms
1.1.8	fixed additional problems with stem routines
	added NT version of SysIni (and started on Unix version, but ...)
	fixed printf format strings for sysdriveinfo
	added attribute support to the NT version fo sysfiletree
	use memory-mapped I/O and bounded strings in sysfilesearch
	fixed echo bug in sysgetkey for Unix
	added sys/time.h to include list for sysscreenux.c (fixes compile problems
	on some platforms)
	consistently initialise screen handles in NT screen routines (fixes
	intermittent failure of the routines, depending on call order)
	added macro space routines (then made them not compile by default)
	added syswaitnamedpipe (tested only for Unix)
1.1.7	fixed additional problems with stem routines, which are now perfect
	added NT versions of SysBootDrive, SysDriveMap, SysSetPriority,
	SysSwitchSession, SysSystemDirectory, SysVolumeLabel
	added volume label to sysdriveinfo
	changed SysFileTree to allow c:\ as a pattern which matches all files in c:\
	changed type bool to type rxbool due to increased reports of issues with
	curses' bool type
	added optional timeout parameter to sysgetkey
	fixed bug with L-format to sysfiletree output on NT
	thanks to Mark Hessling and Ruhsam Bernhard (?Bernhard Ruhsam?)
1.1.6	fixed crash when retrieving values from a stem which has not been set
	this comes up in sysfilesearch, sysstemdelete, and possibly other places
1.1.5	fixed crash when sysfilesearch is called on a file which can't be opened
	fixed file handle leak in sysfilesearch
	added documentation for SysUtilVersion
1.1.4	fixed bugs in sysstemdelete introduced when I made it more efficient
1.1.3	compiled NT version of regstemread to use memory mapped I/O (fixes problem with
	garbage at end of stem, and should improve performance and reduce memory)
	made sysstemdelete more efficient
	speculative fix to sub-directory searching on windows 98
	fixed problem with whole-number arguments to syssleep
1.1.2	added missing options to sysstemsort
	added missing options to sysstemcopy

	replace RTF version of documentation with PDF version
1.1.1	fixed bug which led to crash in regstemread
	added syssteminsert and sysstemdelete
1.1.0	added new functions from IBM's v2 library: sysdumpvariables, sysqueryprocess,
	sysstemcopy, sysstemdelete, syssteminsert, sysstemsort, sysutilversion,
	sysversion
	added some new stem functions which haven't got into IBM's library yet:
	regstemdoover, regstemread, regstemwrite
	substantial changes to key reading on NT
	improvements to sysfilesystemtype
	support for new L option in sysfiletree
1.0.5	fixed bug with output of SysFileTree when no input directory is given
	fixed big in SysSearchPath when the variable is not in the environment
	use upper-case names when registering functions so it works with Rexx/IMC
1.0.4	added documentation
	fixed bugs in sysfiletree: option 'fs' didn't work for WIN32
	in fact, sub-directory searching didn't work when the pattern
	didn't match a directory name, and neither Unix nor WIN32 worked
	from the root directory
	added SysCopyObject, SysMoveObject and SysCreateShadow, which
	I had previously thought weren't useful for non-OS/2 platforms
	added SysTextScreenRead for WIN32
	SysCurState for Unix would core dump if it was the first function
	called
	used the proper termios calls and #defines
	included some example scripts
