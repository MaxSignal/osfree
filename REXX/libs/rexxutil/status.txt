Status of Rexx Utils

The port covers NT and Unix machines. My home system runs FreeBSD and
OS/2, and I run OS/2, NT, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, TRU64, Dynix, and Linux
at work. I'm not touching OS/2, since IBM supplies rexxutil on that
platform. I regularly use some of these routines on all of the platforms
listed above.

The list below breaks functions down by category, which happens to be the
way they're grouped in the source code. `done' means a function
currently works on NT and FreeBSD, and I expect it to work on other Posix
platforms. A platform name means it's implemented for that platform, but
not necessarily the others. /2 means it's done, but it's half-assed and
should be done differently.
