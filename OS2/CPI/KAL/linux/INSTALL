               Installing OS2Linux
	       ===================

OS2Linux must be dowloaded from CVS. There are no distribution files
available. This means you must build the library yourself. Here are the
commands to do that.

$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make

This should build an os2linux.so file which you can then install into your
system. The only other file you will need is a copy of the include/os2.h
file for use in compiling your old OS/2 programs.
